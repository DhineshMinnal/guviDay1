In JavaScript, an object is a unique entity, with properties and their functions.  For example let us consider bike is as object. It has the appearance type, model, specifications as properties and can be used for a ride(its function). The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

In JavaScript, the following datatypes can be considered as objects.

Booleans  (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers  (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings  (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates
Maths
Regular expressions
Arrays
Functions
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
By object literal
By using new keyword
By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:

let obj = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    key3: value3,
    key4: value4,
    .
    .
    .
}



Property and value is separated by colon(:).

Example: var person = {
    name: "yuvaraj"
    age: 28,
    education: BE
}


By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:

    var obj = new Object()

Here, new keyword is used to create object.

Example:
    var emp = new Object()
    emp.id = 101
    emp.name = "Naveen"
    emp.salary = 15000


Accessing JavaScript Objects:
The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

Dot notation: objectName.property

or

Bracket notation: objectName[“property”]

Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator, Here most frequent one is dot notation
